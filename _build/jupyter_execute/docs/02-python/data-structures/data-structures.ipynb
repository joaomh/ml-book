    "# Data Structures in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, a **data structure** is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving, and storing data. They are fundamental building blocks that allow you to manage data efficiently. Python offers several powerful built-in data structures, each with unique properties and use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "A `list` is a versatile and common data structure that holds an ordered collection of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Characteristics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "      * **Ordered:** Items are stored in a defined sequence, and their order will not change.\n",
    "      * **Mutable:** You can change, add, or remove items after the list has been created.\n",
    "      * **Allows Duplicates:** Can contain multiple items with the same value.\n",
    "      * **Indexed:** Items can be accessed using an integer index, starting from `0`.\n",
    "      * **Heterogeneous:** Can contain items of different data types (integers, strings, floats, other lists, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Syntax:**\n",
    "    `[item1, item2, item3, ...]`"
